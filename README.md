Wrong way is a horror narrative driving game inspired by the left and right story, in it the player uses a pc installed on its car to receive specific instructions on how to traverse trough a cursed road at the same time she chats with the other drivers.

The hardest part of Wrong Way was integrating fungus, a framework used on adventure games to show context text, as a dialogue management system for our horror driving game.
